Java programs that have been made for fun and school


CPUMonitor: 
Program is coded through Java FX and UI is based on FXML. 
Program monitors CPU screen usage. 
Analog depicts real-time usage of CPU through hand scaling up and down on the meter. 
Digital shows the percentage of the CPU in real-time. 
The two buttons, Start and Record, change when clicked to Stop and Reset 
  Start begins the program, Stop will halt the program, Reset will set everything back to it's original state - zero. 
  Record will take the percentage that is shown in the digital display and post it on the Record Board which consist of three labels. 
  Everytime the Record button is pressed it will post the percentage and the time it was recorded onto the Record board. The fourth -
  time the Record button is pressed it will replace Record 1 slot, and the fift Record will replace the second slot and so on. 
***Meter still needs to be worked on due to hand only going halfway when reaching 100% whereas 100% should have the hand move all the way to the right of the meter
